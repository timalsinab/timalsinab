# üí´ About Me:

 

I‚Äôm a Computer Science student at Berea College. I‚Äôm passionate about software development and enjoy tackling complex problems with creative solutions. My areas of interest include web development and cybersecurity. I am constantly seeking new challenges to expand my knowledge and skills, and I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects and contribute to the open-source community. Let's connect and build something amazing together!

*** I am currently working on an exciting project with three other individuals to develop an application that allows students to easily request rides in the area. The app will provide a platform for students to connect with drivers, enabling them to quickly and safely get to their desired location. Our team is focused on creating an intuitive user interface and implementing advanced features such as real-time tracking and payment processing. We believe that our app will greatly benefit students in the community and are excited to see the impact it will have once launched. ***
